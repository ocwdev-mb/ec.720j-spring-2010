description: The spiral pine needle stove is one of the projects  developed in this
  class. Pine needles are a plentiful and dense source of energy, but they are difficult
  to control when burning and produce health-threatening gases. By elongating the
  burn path of the fuel around the spiral, the stove uses the energy in the gases
  to get a clean, efficient burn. Courtesy of the students on the Spiral Pine Needle
  Stove team. Used with permission.
